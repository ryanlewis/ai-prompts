# Tips for Writing Effective AI Prompts

## Be Specific and Clear

- **Use precise language**: Avoid ambiguous terms and clearly define what you want
- **Provide context**: Include relevant background information the AI needs to understand your request
- **Set boundaries**: Specify what should and shouldn't be included in the response

## Structure Your Prompts

- **Break down complex tasks**: Divide large requests into smaller, manageable steps
- **Use formatting**: Leverage markdown, bullet points, or numbered lists for clarity
- **Include examples**: Show the AI what kind of output you're looking for

## Optimise for Better Results

- **Iterate and refine**: Don't hesitate to rephrase or add details if the first response isn't quite right
- **Specify the format**: Tell the AI if you want JSON, markdown, code, or plain text
- **Set the tone**: Indicate if you want formal, casual, technical, or creative responses

## Common Patterns

### Role-Based Prompts
Start with "You are a [role]..." to set the AI's perspective and expertise level.

### Chain-of-Thought
Ask the AI to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning" for complex problems.

### Few-Shot Learning
Provide 2-3 examples of input/output pairs to demonstrate the pattern you want.

## Avoid Common Pitfalls

- **Don't be too vague**: "Write something about X" rarely produces useful results
- **Avoid contradictions**: Ensure your requirements don't conflict with each other
- **Watch token limits**: Very long prompts may get truncated or produce incomplete responses

## Advanced Techniques

- **Temperature control**: Request more creative (higher temperature) or focused (lower temperature) responses
- **System prompts**: Use system-level instructions for consistent behavior across conversations
- **Prompt chaining**: Use the output of one prompt as input for the next

## Testing and Validation

- **Test edge cases**: Try your prompts with unusual inputs to ensure robustness
- **Version control**: Keep track of prompt iterations that work well
- **Measure effectiveness**: Document which prompts consistently produce good results

## Some notes on success

### Direct the architecture yourself

Asking LLMs to complete a refactor without direction on how you want things to shape up is asking for trouble. Define (either manually or with LLM help) the files, classes and even the interface/functions you want to end up with. 

You are better completing small and focused refactors instead of large re-architecture of an application.

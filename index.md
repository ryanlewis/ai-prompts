This site contains a curated collection of AI prompts and templates for various tasks and workflows.

## Getting Started

Browse through our collection of prompts organised by category and use case. Each prompt is designed to be:

- **Copy-ready** - Simply copy and paste into your AI tool of choice
- **Customisable** - Easily adapt prompts to your specific needs
- **Well-tested** - All prompts have been validated for effectiveness

## Domain Focus

These prompts are specifically designed around **Jira**, **Python**, and **JavaScript** workflows, covering project management, ticket creation, development practices, testing, and code quality. While these prompts are optimised for these tools, they serve as excellent **examples and templates** that can be easily adapted for:

- Other project management tools (Azure DevOps, Linear, GitHub Issues, etc.)
- Different programming languages and their respective testing/linting workflows
- Similar development and documentation processes

Think of these as proven patterns you can customise for your specific tools and tech stack.

**For coding agents**: These prompts work best when agents have MCP tooling configured for Jira integration, allowing direct interaction with issues and tickets. For local development tools, ensure your project's `CLAUDE.md` includes detailed build and run instructions.

## How to Use This Site

1. **Navigate** using the sidebar to find prompts by category
2. **Preview** prompts to understand their structure and purpose
3. **Copy** the prompt template and customise as needed
4. **Iterate** and refine based on your specific requirements

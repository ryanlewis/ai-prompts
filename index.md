ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ryan. 

I've collated a series of prompts and Claude Code commands that have served me well in my software engineering work. These are the exact prompts I use daily for managing Jira tickets, implementing features, writing tests, and maintaining code quality.

This site contains a curated collection of AI prompts and Claude Code commands specifically designed for **software engineering workflows** - from project management and issue tracking to code implementation, testing, and deployment.

## Getting Started

Browse through the collection of software engineering prompts and commands organised by workflow. Each prompt is designed to be:

- **Copy-ready** - Simply copy and paste into your AI tool of choice
- **Workflow-focused** - Covers complete engineering processes from planning to deployment
- **Tool-aware** - Optimised for modern development tools and practices
- **Well-tested** - All prompts have been validated in real engineering scenarios

## Software Engineering Workflows

These prompts and commands cover key aspects of software development:

- **Project Planning** - Breaking down requirements, creating technical specifications
- **Issue Management** - Creating and implementing Jira tickets, tracking progress
- **Code Implementation** - Structured approaches to feature development and bug fixes
- **Testing & Quality** - Writing tests, ensuring code coverage, maintaining standards
- **Code Review** - Analysing changes, providing feedback, ensuring best practices
- **Documentation** - Technical docs, API references, architectural decisions

## Engineering Stack & Tools

These prompts are specifically designed around **Jira**, **Python**, and **JavaScript** workflows, covering project management, ticket creation, development practices, testing, and code quality. While these prompts are optimised for these tools, they serve as excellent **examples and templates** that can be easily adapted for:

- Other project management tools (Azure DevOps, Linear, GitHub Issues, etc.)
- Different programming languages and their respective testing/linting workflows
- Similar development and documentation processes

Think of these as proven patterns you can customise for your specific tools and tech stack.

**For coding agents**: These prompts work best when agents have MCP tooling configured for Jira integration, allowing direct interaction with issues and tickets. For local development tools, ensure your project's `CLAUDE.md` includes detailed build and run instructions.

## How to Use This Site

1. **Navigate** using the sidebar to find prompts by category
2. **Preview** prompts to understand their structure and purpose
3. **Copy** the prompt template and customise as needed
4. **Iterate** and refine based on your specific requirements

## Contributing

Have a great prompt to share? I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to submit suggestions or improvements through the project repository.

## What This Site Was

This site was a curated collection of AI prompts and Claude Code commands specifically designed for software engineering workflows—from project management and issue tracking to code implementation, testing, and deployment.

## Why It's Archived

Claude Code has evolved significantly. Features like [skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), [hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks), and marketplace plugins now handle these workflows more effectively than copy-paste prompts. The patterns documented here have been superseded by these native capabilities.
